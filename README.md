# Mental Health Data Transformation and PEFT with LORA

This repository contains code for transforming mental health data to the required format of the Mistral7B model, saving the modified data on the Hugging Face online store, and performing the Progressive Early Fusion Transformer (PEFT) using LORA (Learner with Optimized Relevancy Augmentation). Additionally, the model is trained up to 17 epochs and performance evaluation is done on the Command Line Interface (CLI).

## Requirements

- Python (>=3.6)
- PyTorch
- datasets==2.18.0
- trl==0.8.1
- accelerate==0.28.0
- loralib==0.1.2
- transformers==4.39.1
- peft==0.10.0
